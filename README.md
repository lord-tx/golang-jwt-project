# Golang JWT Authentication Project

## Introduction

This project is a simple Golang application that showcases best practices for user and admin authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Features

- User and admin authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Secure user registration with password hashing.
- Authorization middleware to protect routes.
- Role-based access control (user and admin roles).
- Flexible configuration options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- MongoDB or another preferred database system.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-golang-jwt-project.git
  cd your-golang-jwt-project
  go mod tidy
  go run main.go
```

## Usage

### Authentication
- Obtain an authentication token by sending a POST request to `/auth` with valid credentials (username and password).
- Include the obtained JWT token in the Authorization header for protected routes.

### User Registration
- Register a new user by sending a POST request to `/register` with user details.
- New users will be assigned the "user" role by default.

### Admin Privileges
- To access admin-only routes, a user must have the "admin" role.
- Admins can be assigned manually through the database or using an admin endpoint (if implemented).

## Configuration
You can configure the project by modifying the `.env` file or using environment variables. Refer to `CONFIGURATION.md` for detailed configuration options.
